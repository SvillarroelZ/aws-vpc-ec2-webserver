# ☁️ AWS VPC and EC2 Web Server Deployment Lab 🌐

## 📝 Overview
This project demonstrates the **manual deployment of a basic web server** within a **custom-defined AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**.

It serves as **proof of foundational Cloud and DevOps skills** by validating the ability to:
* Design and implement a custom **VPC architecture**.
* Configure **subnets**, **routing**, and **Internet Gateway (IGW)** for public connectivity.
* Establish **Network Security** using **Security Groups (SG)**.
* Automate application installation using **EC2 User Data** scripts.

The lab intentionally avoids using default AWS networking to demonstrate granular control over each component and its role in secure connectivity.

## 🏗️ Architecture Components
The solution is built using the following core AWS services and configurations:

* **Custom VPC:** CIDR Block $10.0.0.0/16$
* **Public Subnet:** CIDR Block $10.0.1.0/24$ (where the web server resides)
* **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attached to the VPC to enable internet access.
* **Route Table:** Configured with a default route ($0.0.0.0/0$) pointing to the IGW.
* **Security Group (SG):** Configured to allow:
    * **SSH (Port 22):** Only from a restricted IP (for security).
    * **HTTP (Port 80):** From anywhere ($0.0.0.0/0$) to serve the web page.
* **EC2 Instance:** Running **Amazon Linux 2** ( t3.micro).
* **Web Server:** **Apache HTTP Server** installed automatically via a **User Data script** (`src/user-data/install-apache.sh`).

An **Architecture Diagram** detailing the flow and component relationship will be added in `assets/architecture-diagram.png`.

## 🛠️ Execution Steps and Validation
The following steps were executed sequentially to provision the infrastructure and validate the web server deployment.

### 1. VPC Creation
The custom VPC was successfully created with the CIDR $10.0.0.0/16$.
* **Screenshot:** [VPC Overview](assets/screenshots/01-vpc-details-overview.png)

### 2. Subnet and Internet Gateway Configuration
A public subnet ($10.0.1.0/24$) was created, and the Internet Gateway was attached to the VPC.
* **Public Subnet:** [Public Subnet Details](assets/screenshots/02-public-subnet.png)
* **Internet Gateway:** [Internet Gateway Attached](assets/screenshots/03-igw-attached.png)

### 3. Routing Setup
The public route table was configured with a default route to the Internet Gateway, enabling outbound and inbound internet traffic for the public subnet resources.

### 4. Security Group (Firewall)
A Security Group was established to act as an instance-level firewall, allowing only necessary traffic (SSH for management and HTTP for the web service).
* **Security Group:** [Security Group Rules](assets/screenshots/05-security-group.png)

### 5. EC2 Instance Provisioning
The EC2 instance was launched into the public subnet, associating the Security Group and utilizing a Key Pair for SSH access. The User Data script was included to automatically install Apache upon launch.
* **Key Pair:** [Key Pairs List](assets/screenshots/06-key-pairs-list.png)
* **Instance Details:** [EC2 Instance Details](assets/screenshots/07-ec2-instance-details.png)

### 6. Validation (SSH and Web Service)
Successful deployment was validated through SSH connection and confirming the Apache web server is running.
* **SSH Success:** [Successful SSH Connection](assets/screenshots/08-ec2-ssh-success.png)
* **Apache Running:** [systemctl status httpd](assets/screenshots/09-ec2-systemctl-httpd-running.png)
